# What is this?
This is Terminal Tick Tack Toe (TTTT). Sure, its a cool name, but literally anyone with c++ knowledge and in an hour or so could make this. Plug in the size of the board, plug in the Number of players, and play away! Keep track of c++ lists beginning at zero.

# How to play?
How to play tick tack toe or how to play this? To play this, git clone and then run in any code editor using filename.cpp. Everything is in one file, which is why there is one file. Done worry about the dependencies, there are no imports to speak of. The game and the game's engine are all written in c++. Not that there is much of a game engine, or really that much of a game...

Make sure you put your position inputs as X, Y and not something dumb like (X, Y) or XY.

Might have some problems with more than three players, but I am sure you can figure it out. A simple solution to this is to not have three people play.

# Why upload to github?
Nothing stopping me, even with something as small as this.

# Future Plans
Truthfully, I want this to evolve a little more. I'm thinking something around the idea of a flask web app hosted on an internet server and/or local network play between two people with computers on the same network.

I might get around to it, I might not. We will see.
